DETAILED DESCRIPTION
  PwshWebSocketClient allows you to interact with web apps over websockets through PowerShell. PwshWebSocketClient is cross platform and infact was written on a Kali Linux VM.
  
  This module is a hard and fast websocket client so it doesn't always follow the standard websocket practices.
  
  Rather than aiming to be a full fledged client, the purpose of the module is to provide
  web application testers with a fast netcat like tool for interacting with websockets during blackbox/whitebox web application tests.

  As a side this module was written while I was earning my OWSE from Offsec's AWAE course.
